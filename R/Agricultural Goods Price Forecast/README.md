## Introduction

Agriculture is referred to as the production, processing and distribution of agricultural goods. 
It can be also the main source income for most developing countries. In addition to providing food and raw material, agriculture also provides employment opportunities to a very large percentage of the population.

## Objetive

We are going to make use of our analytical knowledge to analyze and forecast agricultural goods prices of Rwanda, a developing country.

## Data

For this project we'll use the United Nations Humanitarian Data Exchange Global Food Price Database that can be found [here](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/wfp-food-prices).

The database covers agricultural goods like beans, rice, maize, fish, and sugar for 76 countries and some 1,500 markets. The data is updated weekly and goes back as far as 1992 for a few countries, although many countries started reporting from 2003 or thereafter.
