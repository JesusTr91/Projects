## R projects

The growth and demand for the statistical programming language R perfectly reveals the great importance that the world's most prestigious data scientists, administrations, companies and organizations are giving to predictive analytics. This orientation is a consequence of the new culture that has become widespread respect to data and its importance. Data analysis is becoming increasingly important, as it will later be converted into valuable information.

The real capacity to store and process large sets of data of all kinds requires computer tools capable of detecting patterns in the data analyzed, making it possible to propose rules that can be used to formulate forecasts and trends.

R is the basic reference software in the world of statistics, the most powerful and efficient tool on the market. It is open source and therefore it has no acquisition cost and it is available for all operating systems. Stable, reliable, flexible and cutting-edge software since it is constantly updated with new functions and packages accessible in real time.

This statistical programming language R is designed for statistical calculations, mathematical calculations and creation of graphs in an easy and fast way, with a lot of documentation available thanks to the large active community it has for being a collaborative project.

Here, I've gather the projects I've been working on:
