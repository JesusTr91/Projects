## Introduction

Choosing a major is a difficult decision almost everyone has to make. This milestone will influence every
student’s career trajectory for good or bad.
Young people are encouraged to weight several factors before making a final decision such as:

* Employment rates in the field
* Advanced degree opportunities
* Salary expectations
* Overall program cost

## Objetive

Since its a major life decision, we want to informe young people about the advantages or disadvantages they
may encounter when selecting an specific major. Hence, we will compare the recommendations from three
different methods for determining the optimal number of clusters, apply a k-means clustering analysis, and
visualize the results.

## Data

We will use a year-long survey of 1.2 million people with only a bachelor’s degree by PayScale.Inc that can
be found here.
