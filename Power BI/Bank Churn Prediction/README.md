## Introduction

Today, we live in a digital era and businesses have been saturated by a high supply and demand for services. This has forced companies to transform themselves towards a customer-centric approach, and consequently actions must be taken to take companies a step ahead. Part of this transformation required a reinvention of traditional marketing methods, and this is where Machine Learning comes in to play a transcendental role in the commercial strategy. 
Churn is one of the biggest problems that business fase since it is much more costly to attract new customers than to retain existing ones. Hence, strategies must be created to proactively predict and prevent churn, while at the same time enabling customer loyalty.
With the help of Machine Learning techniques, we can predict the customer's propensity to abandonment based on the customer's history. To achieve this objective, it is necessary to investigate the reasons that may lead to abandonment: behaviors, personal preferences, and other types of characteristics can be analyzed in the process of building a model.

## Objetive

Our goal is to provide the bank insigths of the business situation, in particular how many new customers they have, many potential churns may happen, the variables affection the people that belongs to this group and customer details were they can see each case and churn probability. 
We are going to use Python in order to preprocess our data and apply 3 machine learning algorithms: Decision Trees, Random Forest andExtreme Gradient Boost in order to get the churn probability of each customer. Then use Power BI to deploy our model and get insights about the bank customers.
