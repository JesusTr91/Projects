Every company, regardless of its size, always thinks about creating and delivering the best products and services. That is a laudable position, but especially in today's world, it is unacceptable not to have data analysis as a routine. It is not enough to just develop optimal products or services and even focus only on attracting new customers.

Today, It is necessary to have a critical vision and, through data analysis, extract the maximum amount of information to be useful in business decision making. Thanks to data analysis, companies can access the specific information they need to facilitate their decision making and business strategies based on rigorous criteria. However, data analysis is not only used to facilitate segmentation work.

Power BI allows us to connect to the world of data, create basic and compelling reports, and share efforts with other users. It allows us to access data from hundreds of on-premises and cloud-based sources, such as Dynamics 365, Salesforce, Azure SQL DB, Excel and SharePoint. And also allows you to get practical and detailed insights for a wide variety of scenarios. Analyze data in depth and find otherwise overlooked patterns that lead to practical conclusions.
