## Introduction

What makes a data scientist outstanding is the hability to convert data into valuable and actionable insigths and to provide bussines  added value. How awesome your Python coding or modeling skills can be, these may not be enough to be a good data scientist but the valuable insigths you can get from data and present them in a clear way.

Machine learning is the process of programming computers in order they can learn from data. We use statistical models and alogithms to perform tasks like classification and prediction without explicit instructions. We have to follow a series of steps to apply this technology: Problem formulation, data gathering, data preprocessing, model selection, model evaluation and parameter tunning until we are satisfied with the results.

This technology can be apply to help companies or organizations that provide a service or product to let them know their customers, how they behave and how the company can increase their impact within their customer and increase revenue. 

## Objetive

Our aim is to identify groups of data with similar characteristics or behaviours within a customer dataset. Some of the data that includes this dataset are variables like Age, Gender, District, Household income, Status and information that surrounds events attending. We want investigate what are the common traits among each cluster and deploy our results into a Power BI dashboard for the bussines to use and add them value.

We are going to use SQL to automate data gathering to Power BI for future data. Also, we need Python to preprocess the data and apply the K means algorithm to the data. Finally we will use Power Bi with the data output we get from Python.
