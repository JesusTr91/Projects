## Introduction

Every company, regardless of its size, always thinks about creating and delivering the best
products and services. That is a laudable position, but especially in today's world, it is
unacceptable not to have data analysis as a routine. It is not enough to just develop optimal
products or services and even focus only on attracting new customers.

Nowadays data analytics can help organizations to get insigths easily in order to make datadrven decisions. Data vizualization tolos have become a must since they help to get an easier understanding of the on-going situation of the company helping to improve the efficiency.

## Objetive

Our goal is to turn a csv file (raw data) into a fully automated Power BI dashboard where we
can slice and dice the data in any way we want to readjust the data and look for specific
insights among this organization. It has to include a summary of the transactional fields by
fiscal month and highlight the revenue vs target Budget. Also the breakdown of segmetns
and products and highlight which ones are missing the target and which are hitting the
target by the end of the year. Addicionaly, we want to investigate the relatonship between
revenue and marketing spent to see if there is any correlation.

The raw data used to make this dashboard is synthetic, created randomly with Python.
However, it is data type that any organization has, some of he columns we can find in this
data set are: Revenue, Account, Fiscal month, Product, Transactional fields, Marketing
Budget, etc.
