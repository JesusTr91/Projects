## Summary

This is the second part of a previous project called "Logistic Regression - Credit Approval" that can be found in the Python folder. Basically, I preprocessed the dataset by cleaning it and performed a exploratory data analysis in order to build a machine learning model that can predict if an individual's application for a credit card will be accepted or not.

Hence, I'm using the same dataset, the "Credit Approval Data Set" from the University of California, Irvine Machine Learning Repository, that can be found [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval).

The file concerns credit card applications. All attribute names and values have been changed to meaningless symbols to protect confidentiality of the data. This dataset is interesting because there is a good mix of attributes -- continuous, nominal with small numbers of values, and nominal with larger numbers of values. I also added a new column to the original data set
with some fake geo location information for various US states.

The present dashboard allows us to visualize the distribution of the approved status with certain factors within the population that applies for a credit. These factor are:

* Education Level and Gender
* Age by Education Level
* Just Gender
* Marital Status and Gender
* Age and Gender
* State
* Approval Ratio

It also contain 2 slicers, Education Level and Marital Status, so we can get to see more specific insigths. For example, if you select undergraduate, then all the maps are updated
and they was Show me just the undergraduate, the degree
holders information and then you can have multiple slicers
and then you can have multiple options.
Even from here, if you wanna look at undergraduate
degree holders, who are also married and also females, selecting those parameter the data will be reflected
in all of your plots.
