Power BI is a business analytics tool for visualizing and sharing insights we can get data from hundreds of sources using the same power query tool that's available in Excel. The data we will be working with is 12 months worth of budget and forecast data and 6 months worth of actual data for the it department of a global company. This is a modified data set from obvious the forecast budget and actual data is stored in csv files that have been exported from an accounting system  the files contain records by date, department, cost, element, country and the amount. We also have an excel file containing dimension tables that contain further groupings for the cost element, country and IT departments.  

We want to compare performance against budget or plan if you prefer to call it that and because these are costs an adverse variance will be when actual or forecasted costs are higher than budget. now for those statisticians who might be thinking that variance is the wrong term to use in this project, I have to clarify that this is a term accountants use to refer to the difference between a budgeted value and the actual value.  
This Project consist of 3 dashboards that describe the summary of the company:

* Overview
*	Regions
*	Decomposition
