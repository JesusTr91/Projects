## Introduction 

Power  BI  is  a  business  analytics  tool  for  visualizing and  sharing  insights  we  can  get  data  from hundreds of sources using the same power query tool that's available in Excel. The data we will be working with is 12 months worth of budget and forecast data and 6 months worth of actual data for the it department of a global company. This is a modified data set from obvious the forecast budget and actual data is stored in csv files that have been exported from an accounting system the files contain records by date, department, cost, element, country and the amount. We also have an excel file containing dimension tables that contain further groupings for the cost element, country and IT departments.    

## Objetive 

We want to compare performance against budget and find out if the costs have an adverse variance when actual or forecasted costs are higher than budget. Now for those statisticians who might be thinking that variance is the wrong term to use in this project, I have to clarify that this is a term accountants use to refer to the difference between a budgeted value and the actual value.   

This project consist of 3 dashboards that describe the summary of the company: 

* Overview 
* Regions 
* Decomposition
