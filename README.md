## Welcome to my data analysis portfolio!

My name is Jes√∫s Trejo, geophysicist, scientific researcher and data scientist enthusiast with extensive experience in scientific research and data analysis. I developed this repository to share a summary of my praxis, professional expertise and showcase my skills specifically in data analysis and machine learning.

Here, you'll find projects I've been working on that contemplate various technologies and softwares. These projects include Python, R, Tableau and Power BI, where I have used techniques and methodologies such as data scrapping, filtering, manipulation, visualization, exploratory data analysis and so on. ALso include forecasts and prediction cases using machine learning.
