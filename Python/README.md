## Python Projects

Data Science is responsible for analyzing, transforming data and extracting useful information for decision making. Thanks to Python, these tasks can be carried out without the need for advanced programming knowledge, with few lines of code and in user-friendly programming environments that facilitate programming and visualization of results. 

Python is an interpreted, multi-paradigm, cross-platform programming language used mainly in Big Data, AI (Artificial Intelligence), Data Science, testing frameworks and web development. This makes it a high-level general-purpose language due to its extensive library, whose collection offers a wide range of facilities.
 
Python has become one of the main options to do Data Science due to several factors. Open source, simplicity, availability of libraries, support from the developer community and its extensive library are some of the factors why it has become so popular.

Here, I've gathered some of the projects I have been working on with the purpose of demonstrating my skills.
