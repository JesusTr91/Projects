## Introduction
Physical activity is defined as the movement of the human body produced by muscle contraction that generates energy expenditure above the resting metabolic level, and it's closely related to physical exercise and fitness.

Physical exercise is a planned, structured and repeated body movement performed to maintain or improve one or more components of physical fitness. We understand "Fitness" as the set of attributes or qualities that people have or acquire to improve performance.

Nowadays, thanks to technology we can take an in-depth analytical look at my trainings: running styles, training habits, and achievements. Helped with a GPS fitness tracker you can analyze your workout routines to see how are you performing.

If lockdown has inspired you to lace up your trainers and get running, you’re not alone. And if you haven’t yet – as the days get longer and exercise restrictions are eased, it’s a great time to start.
