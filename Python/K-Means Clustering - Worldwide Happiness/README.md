## Introduction

The World Happiness Report is a publication of the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network. It contains articles and rankings of national happiness, based on respondent ratings of their own lives, which the report also correlates with various life factors that describe life queality. As of March 2021, Finland had been ranked the happiest country in the world four times in a row.

The rankings of national happiness are based on a Cantril ladder survey. Nationally representative samples of respondents are asked to think of a ladder, with the best possible life for them being a 10, and the worst possible life being a 0. They are then asked to rate their own current lives on that 0 to 10 scale. The report correlates the life evaluation results with various life factors.

## Objetive

We are going to train a unsupervise machine learning algorythm know as kmeans clustering with the objetive to cluster countries based on the features such as economic production, social support, life expentency, generosity, freedom to make life choices and perceived corruption. We should get a result showing the segmentation of the data set and rank those groups that will represent a life quality rank.
