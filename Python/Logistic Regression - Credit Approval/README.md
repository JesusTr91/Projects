## Introduction

One of the biggest problems banks used to face was the large number of applications for credit cards. People could be rejected by having low income level or high loan balances and analyzing these applications one by one was a headache. Fortunately, today we have technology and this tasks can be automated with the power of machine learning.

## Objetive

Firstly we want our data in good shape so our model to make good predictions, consequentely we are going to preprocess the dataset by cleaning it so we can perform the exploratory data analysis. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can predict if an individual's application for a credit card will be accepted or not.

## Data

We will use the "Credit Approval Data Set" from the University of California, Irvine Machine Learning Repository, [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval).

The file concerns credit card applications. All attribute names and values have been changed to meaningless symbols to protect confidentiality of the data. This dataset is interesting because there is a good mix of attributes -- continuous, nominal with small numbers of values, and nominal with larger numbers of values.
