## Introduction

One out of every three employees who meet these three characteristics: a company with little involvement, little interaction with colleagues and a low happiness index, will leave the company in a matter of weeks. On the contrary, those employees who are participative, have a happiness index at or above average and work in a company involved in the well-being of the organization remain in their jobs in 99.5% of the cases.

Attracting and retaining talent is one of the keys to the present and future for many companies. A high turnover rate not only increases human resources costs, which can reach up to 150% of the annual salary per employee replaced, but also has social costs, as turnover usually means lower salaries, a decrease in productivity per employee and, logically, a workforce that is less loyal to their companies.

The cost of high employee turnover is one of the variables that companies often pay less attention to, and yet it is a very important fact, because companies invest time and resources in training workers, so losing them means losing that investment.

## Objetive

Since personnel its one of the most valuable resources of a company, it is advisable to develop a model that allows organizations to predict when a worker is going to leave their job, so that companies could avoid that turnover and with it the costs associated with a change of employee.

We aim to analyze several factors of a dataset of around 15,000 employees through the Happyforce platform, which takes the pulse of the organization by measuring aspects such as employee well-being, personnel engagement, management quality and other company factors and use machine learning models to predict future personnel turnover in order to find strategies like bonuses or incentives that may reduce personnel turnover within the organization or bussineses.
