## Introduction
Covid 19 outbreak, a subject that is not indiferent to anybody, has affected all levels of the society in many ways: economy, education, tourism, employment, entertainment, and the list goes on and on. Since early 2020, we have been facing a global health crisis unlike any in the 75-year United Nations history. A crisis that has cost lives, suffering and, in the least of the cases, upending peopleâ€™s lives.

With massive data volumes being generated daily, healthcare professionals and researchers have an opportunity to fight the pandemic by analyzing the data so world leaders make accurate and effective countermeasures to fight the pandemic.

## Objetive
The fist step in order to solve a problem, is to understand it, and we can do this by deep dive into the data and ask us questions. For this particular project we want to solve the following ones:

* How has the virus spread across the world?
* How confirmed cases, deaths and recovery has fluctuated across the world?
* What's the current status at each contry?
