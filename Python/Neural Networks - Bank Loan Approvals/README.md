## Introduction

Artificial intelligence and machine learning have been transforming the banking industry in many aspects, such as automatic fraud detection, bank customers segmentation and automation of many processes. Particularly, when there is an application for credit, the bank evaluates whether the person or company is able to pay the loan plus interest in a certain time, for this they use measures of profitability, leverage and many other variables such as liquidity to calculate the risk, a complex task that can sometimes be inaccurate.

Machine Learning is capable of generating credit risk models based on financial data and the credit and consumption behavior of its customers. They can also identify when to increase or reduce a customer's credit line, gauging the bank's tolerance to risk.

## Objetive

Most bank customers are depositors and the bank would like to start targeting those customers who are worthy to issue personal loans and make revenue by charging them interests. Therefore, the bank would like to retain those depositors and convert them to personal loan customers and therefore growing aanual rvenue.

In this project we will assume that you work as a data scientist at the bank and the bank management team would like to build and train a deep neural network model to predict the likelihood off customers buying personal loans based on their features, such as their age, experience, income, family education and credit card information that can be able to predict the likelihood of customers liability.
